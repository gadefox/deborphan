CONFIGURATION
-------------
You can configure some default values at compile-time. Some of these
may be overridden at run-time. See the list of C constants below for
a detailed explanation of the options.

The configure options that do not take an argument (like --with-isfa)
can be set by using --without-var (e.g. --without-isfa).

configure option           C-constant                 override at runtime
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--with-priority=PRIOR      DEFAULT_PRIORITY                yes
--with-isfa                ALL_PACKAGES_IMPLY_SECTION      yes
                           STATUS_FILE                     yes
                           REG_FLAGS                       no
                           KEEPER_FILE                     yes
--without-debfoster        IGNORE_DEBFOSTER                yes
                           DEBFOSTER_KEEP                  no
--with-ignore-essential    IGNORE_ESSENTIAL                no
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following constants are defined at the bottom of config.h:
 STATUS_FILE   - The location of your status file
                 (default: "/var/lib/dpkg/status")
 DEFAULT_PRIORITY - The default priority to use when searching for packages.
                    See the manual page (under --priority) for more information
                    (default: 2)
 REG_FLAGS     - Bitwise or'd list of options to pass to regcomp(3). Unsetting
                 REG_ICASE will violate the dpkg standard, but is not likely
                 to cause problems. Note that REG_EXTENDED is hard-coded.
                 (default: REG_ICASE)
 KEEPER_FILE   - Location of the file to store information about kept back
                 packages. This can only be changed via src/Makefile.am.
                 (default: /var/lib/deborphan/keep)
 ALL_PACKAGES_IMPLY_SECTION - Imply --show-section if --all-packages is used.
                              Shows in which sections the packages are. Can be
                              overridden with --no-show-section at runtime.
                              (default: 1)
 IGNORE_DEBFOSTER - Ignore debfoster's keepers file by default.
                    (default: 0)
 DEBFOSTER_KEEP   - Location of debfoster's keepers file. Undefine to never
                    use debfoster's keepfile.
                    (default: configure)
 IGNORE_ESSENTIAL - Ignore 'Essential: yes' lines in package information.
                    (default: 0)

To get deborphan to run faster, run configure with the following options:
--with-priority=4 --without-isfa
--with-bufsize=2000 --disable-nls --with-ignore-essential

INSTALLATION
------------
Run the following commands:
  ./configure [your options]
  make all
  make install

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If compilation fails on NLS (in po/ or intl/), try passing the
--disable-nls option to configure. If you don't want to use the
Dutch messages, supply --disable-nls for slightly faster operation.

REMOVING ALL SUGGESTED PACKAGES
-------------------------------
apt-get -u remove `deborphan -p4`
Never run this command without looking at deborphan's output first!

If you decide you want to keep some packages use:
  deborphan -A libfoo libbar lib...
  apt-get -u remove `deborphan -p4`

Next time you run deborphan, it will not display libfoo and libbar.
See the manual page for more information.

LISTING ALL UNINSTALLED PACKAGES
--------------------------------
deborphan --find-config lists uninstalled packages which still have
configuration files left on the system. Listing all uninstalled packages,
including those that don't have any configuration files left, is not
supported by deborphan, since this is already implemented in dpkg. Use the
following command to display them:  dpkg -l | grep '^rc' | awk '{print $2}'

BUGS
----
deborphan does not check for "or" dependencies, i.e. when a package
depends on libfoo OR libbar, both libfoo and libbar will be marked as
being in use. Unless someone comes up with a bit of code to do this
really fast, it will never be implemented.

If you discover a new bug, send a message describing your problems,
the output of deborphan, and your /var/lib/dpkg/status (if that is not
too private information) to c.hey@web.de, or to the Debian BTS if you
are using the Debian package.
